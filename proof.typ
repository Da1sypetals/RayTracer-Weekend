== Problem: 
#v(0.3%)
 $2^(1/n)$ is irrational with $n in NN$ and $n>=2$.
#v(1%)
== Proof:
#v(0.3%)
- $n=2$ is trivial.
- For $n >=3$, prove by contradiction. 
  - Suppose there exist $p,q in NN$ where $
    2^(1/n)=p/q
    $
  - We have
  $
    2&=(p^n)/(q^n)
    \
    2q^n&=p^n
\
    q^n+q^n&=p^n space space space space (*)
  $
  By Fermat's Last Theorem, $(*)$ does not hold, thus a contradiction is reached. $square$
